		<BasketHeader>Description</BasketHeader>
		<p>
			The Bao DeFi Basket is divided into key DeFi sectors, which are given a
			weighting reflecting their maturity and share of the overall market.
			Within those sectors, each project is weighted on the TVL divided by Fully
			Diluted Valuation (FDV).
		</p>
		<Spacer />
		<BasketHeader>Objective</BasketHeader>
		<p>
			To generate revenue a defi project needs value deposited into their
			contracts. This makes Total Value Locked (TVL) a key metric for evaluating
			a project's ability to generate revenue. Projects with a high TVL are also
			likely to gain more traction in the market through the network effects the
			existing capital provides - capital attracts more capital. A good example
			of this is with Yearn Finance. Yearn was able to generate massive amounts
			of revenue as a result of the large amount of capital they attracted. This
			gave them the resources to further develop and innovate their products in
			a positive feedback loop. Yearn’s success has led to many projects such as
			Alchemix and Abracadabra using their products and liquidity as a base
			layer to build on.
		</p>
		<p>
			bDEFI is composed of the strongest components in the DeFi ecosystem,
			striving to provide core coverage of the key building blocks for the
			future of finance. With bDEFI you’ll have exposure to infrastructure,
			lending markets, decentralized exchanges, synthetics, and yield
			aggregators. The unique weighting formula allows the basket to invest in
			projects gaining traction earlier and with a greater weighting than market
			cap weighted baskets.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Bao DeFi Basket will provide the crypto industry's first automated
			value investing, decentralized, tokenized portfolios. When you add the
			prospect of the underlying tokens being put to work to earn yield.

		<BasketHeader>Criteria</BasketHeader>
		<p>
			For a project to be included in the Bao Defi Basket, it must fit the below

		</p>
		<BasketSubHeader>Characteristics</BasketSubHeader>
		<BasketList>
			<li>Be a DeFi project available on the Ethereum blockchain.</li>
			<li>Listed on DefiLlama</li>
			<li>
				Have at least 7.5% of the total supply in circulation and have a
				predictable token emission over the next 5 years.
			</li>
			<li>
				The protocols will be selected by TVL based on DeFiLlama’s website.
			</li>
			<li>
				The protocol must be running for 3 months before qualifying to be
				included in the basket.
			</li>
			<li>
				In the event of a safety incident, the team must have addressed the
				problem responsibly and promptly, providing users of the protocol a
				reliable solution and document a detailed, transparent breakdown of the

			<li>Must be sufficiently decentralised</li>

		<BasketHeader>Strategy</BasketHeader>
		<p>
			It is possible for the underlying tokens to utilize strategies that will

		<p>The Basket is maintained quarterly in two phases.</p>

		</p>
		<p>
			The determination phase takes place during the final 2 weeks of the

		</p>
		<p>
			Proposed changes will be published on the governance forum for 1 week then

		<BasketHeader>Description</BasketHeader>
		<p>
			The Bao Stable Basket provides a way to diversify counterparty risk on
			stable assets while the underlying assets are put to work earning yield on
			various trusted yield farming protocols. Decentralized and non pegged
			stables will be used where yield is available.
		</p>
		<BasketSubHeader>Fees</BasketSubHeader>

		<Spacer />
		<BasketHeader>Objective</BasketHeader>
		<p>
			The objective of the Bao Stable Basket is to provide exposure to a
			diversified basket of stable coins with a focus on yield and
			decentralization.
		</p>
		<p>
			By spreading risk over a number of coins, you reduce the impact of
			problems any single tokens face. Since the basket does not automatically
			rebalance, one stable losing its peg would not affect the other tokens in
			the basket.
		</p>
		<p>
			By focusing on decentralized stables, you also reduce exposure to
			regulatory risk and do not rely on central issuers to continually act as
			they should.
		</p>
		<p>
			The basket will start with a mixture of centrally issued and decentralized
			stable coins and deposit them in a variety of protocols to earn yield on
			them, swapping strategies regularly to maximize the yield earned.
		</p>
		<Spacer />
		<BasketHeader>Criteria</BasketHeader>
		<p>
			For a project to be included in the Bao Stable basket, it must fit the
			below criteria in order to reduce the risk of the basket and fit the
			desires of the community.
		</p>
		<BasketSubHeader>Characteristics</BasketSubHeader>
		<BasketList>
			<li>Be a stable token project available on the Ethereum blockchain.</li>
			<li>
				Be in liquid markets and being used in different lending protocols.
			</li>
			<li>
				The protocol must be running for 6 months before qulaifying to be
				included in the basket.
			</li>
			<li>
				In the event of a safety incident, the team must have addressed the
				problem responsibly and promptly, providing users of the protocol a
				reliable solution and document a detailed, transparent breakdown of the
				incident.
			</li>
			<li>Must be sufficiently decentralized and/or collateralized.</li>
		</BasketList>

		<BasketHeader>Strategy</BasketHeader>
		<p>
			It is possible for the underlying tokens to utilize strategies that will
			earn yield, maximising value for basket holders, who benefit from this
			productivity without having to perform any actions themselves. These
			strategies will be changed over time to take advantage of new

		</p>
		<Spacer />
		<BasketHeader>Management</BasketHeader>
		<p>The Basket is maintained quarterly in two phases.</p>

		<BasketSubHeader>Determination Phase</BasketSubHeader>
		<p>
			The determination phase takes place during the final 2 weeks of the
			quarter. During this phase the changes needed for the next reconstitution
			are determined. Strategies and allocation % will be revisited in order to
			reach the balance between decentralization and having the most optimal yet
			secure yield possible for those stables. Proposed changes will be
			published on the governance forum for 1 week then a governance vote will
			run for the community to approve changes.
		</p>
		<BasketSubHeader>Reconstitution Phase</BasketSubHeader>
		<p>
			In the two weeks following a successful vote, the basket components will
			be adjusted as per the instructions published during the final 2 weeks of
			the quarter.
		</p>
		<BasketSubHeader>Emergency Maintenance</BasketSubHeader>
		<p>
			The multisig holders are authorized by the community to re-balance baskets
			outside the usual schedule during moments that they collectively deem to
			be critical emergencies. This clause will allow for quick re-balancing in
			the event of a protocol or basket being in danger of failing.
		</p>
		<p>
			An example of when this would be utilized would be if a stable coin begins
			losing its peg/becoming insolvent, or a protocol suffers an exploit that
			is not dealt with sufficiently. These scenarios may be time sensitive and
			require immediate resolution. Thus the team may decide to act without
			warning and explain their actions in a governance forum post afterwards,
			or if there is deemed to be time, an emergency governance vote will be
			posted.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is intended as a safety mechanism only, to prevent loss of users
			funds and as such would be a power exclusively exercised under extreme
			circumstances.
